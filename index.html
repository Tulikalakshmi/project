                    <h5>Acro yoga</h5>
                    <p>AcroYoga is a combination of yoga, acrobatics, and Thai massage. It involves partners working together to perform various poses that typically include a base, a flyer, and a spotter. The base provides stability and support, the flyer balances on the base, and the spotter ensures safety. AcroYoga emphasizes trust, communication, and connection between partners while building strength, flexibility, and body awareness.</p>

                    <h5>Vinyasa yoga</h5>
                    <p>Vinyasa yoga is a dynamic and flowing style of yoga that synchronizes breath with movement. It involves a series of poses or asanas linked together in a sequence, transitioning smoothly from one posture to another. The practice focuses on coordinating breathing patterns (often using Ujjayi breath) with each movement, creating a continuous flow. Vinyasa yoga helps build strength, flexibility, balance, and mindfulness while offering various sequences that can vary in intensity and pace.</p>

                    <h5>Hatha yoga</h5>
                    <p>Hatha yoga is a traditional form of yoga that focuses on physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), and relaxation methods. It aims to achieve balance between body and mind by emphasizing the practice of asanas to align, strengthen, and promote flexibility in the body. Hatha yoga often involves slower-paced movements, holding poses for a longer duration, and paying attention to breath control. It serves as a foundation for many other styles of yoga and is practiced to enhance overall well-being and promote inner harmony.</p>

                    <h5>Kundalini yoga</h5>
                    <p>Kundalini yoga is a spiritual and dynamic form of yoga that aims to awaken the Kundalini energy, believed to be coiled at the base of the spine. This practice involves a combination of physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), chanting, meditation, and sometimes, repetitive movements known as kriyas. The primary focus of Kundalini yoga is to unlock and elevate this dormant energy, promoting spiritual growth, self-awareness, and a heightened state of consciousness. It's often seen as a powerful practice for expanding awareness, accessing inner potential, and cultivating a sense of connection between the mind, body, and spirit.</p>
